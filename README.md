## 1  Formatting SD card.

insert sd card and find its acces path.

```bash
df | grep sd
```
 
here sd is the charachters likely to be an sd card this may change depending on media

/dev/sda        62571552       32  62571520   1% /media/frida/5360-3F30
```

then unmount using umount:

```bash
sudo umount /media/frida/5360-3f30
```

format card using mkfs

```bash
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 -v /dev/sda
